      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m Paul Jericho Marata, a Computer Engineering graduate with a passion for both web development and robotics. I enjoy building smart, functional systems—whether it’s designing websites or working with embedded technologies like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>
      <p>My journey started in robotics and automation, where I worked on machine learning, image processing, and hardware integration. Over time, I expanded into full stack web development, using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Flutter to create responsive and user-friendly applications.</p>
      <p>I’m always driven to learn more, improve my skills, and build tech that makes an impact.</p>
